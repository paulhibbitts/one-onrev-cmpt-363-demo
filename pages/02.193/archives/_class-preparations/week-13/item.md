## Nov 26th Preparations

While there are no required preparations for our last class of CMPT 363 this term, I would suggest you think about [the learning objectives of the course](https://canvas.sfu.ca/courses/47119/assignments/syllabus), the main topics explored, and come with any questions that you may have about the course materials or final exam.
